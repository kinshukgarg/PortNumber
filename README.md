# Domain Port Subdomain Status Checker

This project is a web-based tool that helps to check the port numbers, subdomains, and HTTP status codes of a given domain. It consists of two main components:

- **Backend:** A Go (Golang) server that handles domain analysis.
- **Frontend:** A React-based user interface for easy interaction with the tool.

## Features

- **Port Check:** Get the status of common ports (like 80, 443, etc.) for a given domain.
- **Subdomain Enumeration:** List possible subdomains of the domain.
- **HTTP Status Code:** Retrieve the HTTP status code for the main domain and subdomains.
- **Easy Interface:** User-friendly React frontend for smooth interaction.
